## Task 3 - Looping and Accessing

We can use the useful loops we learned to access the items in an array.

ðŸ‘‰ In a while loop, console.log the array item at the current index and add 1 to the index variable.

ðŸ‘‰ Have the while loop run until the index is equal to or greater than the array's length property.
